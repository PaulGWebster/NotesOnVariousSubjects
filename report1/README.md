# A report on the state of current perl

## Brutal list of personal issues
* Modules not working as expected
* No realistic examples
* No cookbook recipes
* Failing tests (async)
* High number of alternatives, to most modules - none of which work 
* Decayed frameworks (POE, ... many many others)
* Smaller specialised modules not working at all (choose a random 10 modules)
* Horrific 90s CGI interfaces to author submission portal (PAUSE)
* Broken intro's to the language 
* Chance of a random selection of 10 modules: having tests, passing tests and then actually functioning is about 1%
* No reasonable ways to offer forks of modules (even if they are on github to begin with)
* No flavour support
* Lack of standard style throughout entire community
* Lack of a standard set of modules that are carefully picked and updated
*
